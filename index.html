      <h2 class = "special">Bio</h2>
      <p>My life as a Java developer began in elementary school.  After reading a PC World magazine in a dentist's office at the age of 9, I developed a great interest in tech.  I wanted to read any material I could get my hands on about the tech industry.  My first interaction with programming was a C++ class in 10th grade.  It was an awesome course and I learned so much.  But I never saw any representations of people I could relate to who were in the tech industry.  No one looked like me.  As technology advances and becomes more ingrained in everyone's life, I was drawn back to this industry.  I want to be the example for young Detroiters who's curious about tech but doesn't see a reflection of it in their community.</p>
